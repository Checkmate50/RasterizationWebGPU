# CS5626 Rasterization with WebGPU

I've elected to do this project with WebGPU, for some reason. It's been pretty fun so far. This actually seems like it's going better so far than the ray tracing in Rust project. WebGPU is more low level than OpenGL, but I think it's useful to play around with a more modern standard.
